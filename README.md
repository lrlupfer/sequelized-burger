BURGERMANIA THE SEQUEL

This is a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and SEQUELIZE this time (rather than our "homemade" ORM).

As a user, you can input the name of a burger you'd like to eat. You can eat burgers, or return them to the menu to be devoured by someone else. You can also delete burgers from the menu or devoured list.

Future development: I ran out of time to style the app. I'd like to return to this app to add a logo and style it.
